This is a simple wrapping for [webshim](https://github.com/aFarkas/webshim).

The version of the Meteor package matches the version of webshim so wrapped.

Including the package is essentially the Meteor equivalent of placing a script tag in your HTML.

There is no separate repo for this, but it the details of how it is wrapped may be found [here](https://github.com/convexset/meteor-three-way/tree/master/packages/webshim).
